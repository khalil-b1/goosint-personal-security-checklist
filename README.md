Goosint is a personal project that started out in May 2023 as initially for sharing amazing, free, and ready-to-use [Open-source intelligence (OSINT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence) tools for cybersecurity specialists.
At the end of 2023, the plateform has expanded to cover other topics in the field of peoples‚Äô safety in France, and Information Security in general.
In February 2025, I decided to migrate my website, goosint.com, with +300 resources curated for almost 2 years to github.com and make it more collaborative.
